            Ideal classes established in 2008. Your search for best Science classes for 11th ,12th and Engineering Diploma and Degree in Pune ends at Parag Sir's Ideal classes. Ideal Class is situated in Kothrud. More then 8500 students have quality education under the guidance of Prof. Parag Korhale at our academy. Ideal classes comes with a vision to create a remarkable impact on society by providing quality education with complete mentorship as we only do to building a highly, impactful and strong foundation of students so they can compete any competition with remarkable results.
            Everyone seems to have come to terms with the need for extra tutoring. However, confusion remains over the type of coaching, that is the best.
            Group tutoring or private tutoring, which one is better? Group tutoring has a classroom kind of environment, with many students and a single tutor, for each subject.
            Private tutoring is more personal and is a one-to-one tuition method. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Both styles of tutoring have their pros and cons.
            We’ll break it down for you, so you can make an informed choice when it comes to selecting a tutoring style, best suited for your child.
            In today’s world Competition is everywhere, in every sector, in every industry, and at every level. When it comes to education each and every student wants to excel in his/her class, school, city, state or even in the country. In personal tuition, you’ll have fewer distractions compared to in a large class setting, so you’ll get more out of each lesson and become more fluent faster than if you were in a group class. Also In a group tuition , you will learn from other students as well as the teacher. To improve student performance we take a series of short weekly mid-terms with formative assessment before a final exam coupled with creative grading can help students learn better. This can be extremely beneficial for students those are average in their studies . You can ask questions and get feedback from your peers.
